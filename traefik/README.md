# Traefik

Traefik is a resverse http proxy and load balancer, This is used to tie all of my services together and allow some of the externally, where as others are only internal.

The version I run has tied in with Authelia the cloudflare to provide 2FA and wildcard Let's Encrypt certficates so everything is secure.

I also have the traefik dasshboard set up and covered by authelia as well as being connected to traefik pilot for testing
